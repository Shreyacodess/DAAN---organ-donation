## Daan- An Organ Donation Website

#### A Submission to Hackx Hackathon

**Problem statement open inovation in Health care**

Our project is a full-featured online application that allows a hospital administrator to add or remove organs (kidney, lungs, and pancreas) from the database once they have been given or removed from a specific hospital. During COVID circumstances, our solution also incorporates Plasma. Apart from the hospital administration, our programme also enables for typical user contact. If a regular user chooses to donate organs or plasma, he can send a message using the app. Through an API, that message is transmitted directly to the Hospital email address. Our customer can also look for organs that he requires immediately. Once the user has chosen the organ that he need, the database is thoroughly searched, and if that organ is found, it is shown.The name of the hospital, as well as all of the information about that organ (age of the donor, sex of the donor, and so on) is then shown.

We ran into a lot of challanges. Primarily, fetching that particular request from the database. Also we wanted to include a geocoder which would allow the user to search by his address and his particular location. We couldnt implement that due to a lack of time. Also a lot and lot of bug fixes along the way.
